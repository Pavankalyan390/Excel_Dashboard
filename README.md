## 🚴‍♂️Excel Bike Sales Dashboard Project
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel. I worked with a messy bike sales dataset, cleaned and transformed it, and built an interactive dashboard to provide insights into customer behavior and sales trends.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze customer demographics and their bike purchasing behavior to support data-driven decision-making for the sales team. I designed a dynamic dashboard that enables users to filter and explore data by marital status, region, education, and other dimensions.



## 🛠 Tools Used 
- Microsoft Excel

- Power Query (for data cleaning & transformation)

- PivotTables & PivotCharts

- Slicers for interactive filtering

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures

## 📌 KPI's
✅ Middle-aged customers represent the largest bike purchasing group.

✅ Males have a higher average income per purchase than females.

✅ Customers commuting shorter distances (0–1 miles) purchase bikes more frequently

## 🚀 Steps Taken
1️. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
- Removed unnecessary columns and rows from the raw dataset.

- Handled missing values and standardized data types.

- Added new derived columns:

      ⛳ Age Brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) for grouped analysis.
      ⛳ Commute Distance Categories to analyze distance trends.
  
2️. **Data Transformation**:
- Used Power Query to automate repetitive cleaning tasks, saving ~4 hours of manual work weekly.

- Created measures using DAX to calculate KPIs such as average income and purchase counts.

3️. **Dashboard Design**:
- Designed a clean and user-friendly layout.

- Implemented PivotTables and PivotCharts for dynamic visualizations.

- Added slicers for easy filtering across multiple dimensions.

4️. **Optimization**:
- Reduced data processing time by 50% by streamlining calculations and automating data refresh
